**Python Imaging Library** (known as **Pillow** in newer versions) is a library in Python that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving lots of different image file formats.

Pillow offers several standard procedures for image manipulation. These include:

- Per-pixel manipulations
- Masking and transparency handling

- Image enhancing, like sharpening and adjusting brightness, contrast or color
- Adding text to images (and much more!)
