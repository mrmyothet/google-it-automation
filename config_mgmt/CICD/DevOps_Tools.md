# DevOps Tools

So, what are DevOps tools? They’re any software tools that help to make automated processes possible. DevOps tools are designed to address many of the pain points common to software development organizations everywhere.

While you can certainly build your own tools from scratch, using DevOps tools can save you a lot of time and effort.

There are many different types of DevOps tools including:

- **Source code repositories**: such as GitHub or Bitbucket
- **CI/CD tools**: such as Github Actions, Jenkins, and Google Cloud Deploy
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools**: such as Terraform or Ansible
- **Container management tools**: such as Docker or Kubernetes
- **Security scanning tools**: such as Snyk or SonarQube
- **Production monitoring tools**: such as DataDog or AppDynamics

## How to Choose the Right Tools

But how do you know which tools to use? Let’s think about the DevOps lifecycle. This will help you determine which tools are the best fit at each stage.

### Discover

During discovery, look for tools that encourage brainstorming to happen asynchronously. This allows everyone on your team to share and comment on anything and will be important throughout the DevOps lifecycle. Examples of tools you can use include Jira Product Discovery, Miro, and Mural.

### Plan

When you get to the planning stage, look for tools that provide options for sprint planning and issue tracking, as well as continued collaboration. Examples of tools you can use include Jira Software, Confluence, and Slack.

### Build

During the building stage, look for tools that allow you to create individual development environments, reprovision those development environments, monitor versions with version control, continuously integrate and test, and have source control of your code. Also look for tools that allow for continuous integration, delivery, and feedback. Examples of tools you can use include Kubernetes and Docker.

### Test

Automation is essential for DevOps, so look for tools that can automate testing and support wallboards, sharing, and commenting on particular builds or deployments. Examples of tools you can use include Veracode and SmartBear Zephyr Squad or Zephyr Scale.

### Monitor

Look for tools that can integrate with your group chat clients and send you notifications or alerts when you’ve automated monitoring your servers and application performance. An example tool you can use is Jira Software.

### Operate

Deployment and operation will have similar needs. For deployment, look for tools that can integrate your code repository and deployment tools in a single dashboard. Once your software has deployed, look for tools that can track incidents, changes, problems, and software projects on a single platform. It’s easier to find, identify, and resolve issues when they’re all in the same place. An example tool you can use is Jira Software.

### Continuous Feedback

It’s important to continuously receive feedback on your builds and gain insights from that feedback. Look for applications that can integrate your chat clients with a survey platform or social media platform. Examples of tools you can use include Slack and GetFeedback.

## Popular Tools for CI/CD

- **Jenkins**, **GitLab**, **Travis CI**, and **CircleCI** are all tools which can automate the different stages of the software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying. They are often used in DevOps to continuously build and test software, which allows you to continuously integrate your changes into your build.
- Tools like **Spinnaker**, **Argo CD**, and **Harness** can be used to automate continuous delivery and deployment and to simplify your DevOps processes.

## Pro Tips

- **Pro tip #1**: Don’t throw out your entire process just because a new tool doesn’t fit into your existing pipeline. Choose tools that will fit your workflow and slot into your pipeline easily.
- **Pro tip #2**: Consider that the most popular tools have the broadest base of support and the largest number of practitioners, making it easier for new team members to get up to speed quickly. This also means that there’s more online support and forums for discussion available to you.

## Key Takeaways

There are many different DevOps tools available out there—some will have multiple functions and others will be designed for a single purpose. Some tools will share the same functionalities and can be used in more than one stage of the DevOps lifecycle. It’s important to choose the tools that will best fit your workflow and slot into your pipeline easily. Remember, the tools are there to help make DevOps processes like automation and continuous integration, development, and delivery easier for you.
